# v1.0.3 — RhinoSpotter 5.3/5.4 editable bookmark compatibility

This maintenance release updates the shared RhinoSpotter synchronization path used by **ED Hotspots Finder - Rings & Planets** and the **Hotspots Finder EDMC Plugin**.

## Changes

- Preserve RhinoSpotter bookmark identity when reading through the documented `rs_api.py` interface.
- RhinoSpotter edits to **Location**, **Material**, **Rigs**, **Amount**, **Density** and depletion state now update the existing Community Deposits report instead of creating a new report identity.
- Existing reports synchronized by v1.0.2 remain compatible with the new identity logic.
- Re-synchronizing unchanged bookmarks still returns `unchanged` and does not intentionally advance the deposit's visible **Updated** timestamp.
- No changes are required to Community Deposits scanning, result display or the EDMC navigation tracker.
- Compatibility was verified against RhinoSpotter 5.4 with `SCHEMA = 1`.

## Distribution

The unified v1.0.3 GitHub Release contains:

```text
ED-Hotspots-Finder-Rings-and-Planets-v1.0.3.exe
Hotspots-Finder-EDMC-Plugin-v1.0.3.zip
SHA256.txt
```

The public Windows executable remains unsigned, so Windows SmartScreen may display an unknown-publisher warning.

# v1.0.2 — Community Deposits, RhinoSpotter API and EDMC Plugin

This release expands the existing v1.0.2 maintenance update into the first unified **ED Hotspots Finder + Hotspots Finder EDMC Plugin** release.

The desktop Finder and the EDMC plugin share the same Community Deposits service and the same public release version.

## ED Hotspots Finder changes

- Added automatic detection of RhinoSpotter 5.1+ `rs_api.py` from the EDMC plugin folder.
- RhinoSpotter bookmarks are now read through `rs_api.bookmarks()` when available.
- Direct SQLite and legacy JSON access remain compatibility fallbacks for older RhinoSpotter installations.
- Settings reports the detected RhinoSpotter API version and bookmark count.
- Synchronization confirmation and completion dialogs report the actual source used.
- Missing planet radii can be recovered from another bookmark on the same body when available.
- Stable report IDs are preserved so existing Community Deposits reports are updated instead of duplicated.
- Synchronization now distinguishes **new**, **matched**, **updated** and **unchanged** reports.
- Re-synchronizing an unchanged report no longer intentionally advances the deposit's visible **Updated** time on the Community Deposits service.
- **Rigs** is now treated as mutable Community Deposits data, alongside **Amount** and depletion state, so RhinoSpotter edits can update an existing deposit.
- Added the missing **Location** column to Community Deposits results.
- Enabled **Check for updates on startup** and added a direct GitHub repository link in Settings.
- Standardized Community Deposits dialogs on the public application title.
- The Windows release is now distributed directly as the versioned standalone executable instead of wrapping the Finder in an additional ZIP.

## Hotspots Finder EDMC Plugin

v1.0.2 also introduces the first public release of the EDMarketConnector plugin, published as:

```text
Hotspots-Finder-EDMC-Plugin-v1.0.2.zip
```

Main features:

- **Sync Bookmarks** through RhinoSpotter 5.1+ `rs_api.py`.
- **Scan System** for Community Deposits in the current Elite Dangerous system.
- Cached **Open Deposits** without unnecessary repeat API requests.
- **Refresh Deposits** only when relevant synchronized data changed.
- Results table with Body, Location, Material, Rigs, Amount, Density, Latitude, Longitude, Reports and Updated.
- **Start Tracking** with a compact always-on-top navigation HUD.
- Tracker display of material and RhinoSpotter **Location**.
- **Travel to <system>** when the selected deposit is in another system.
- **Approach body <body>** while surface coordinates are not yet available.
- Altitude-aware target distance during aerial approach.
- Heading-relative direction arrow.
- Independent saved tracker position.
- **Open Finder** directly from EDMC.
- Automatic update check using the same GitHub release channel as the desktop Finder.

The plugin uses the same Community Deposits backend as the desktop application and does not maintain a separate deposit database.

## Distribution

The unified v1.0.2 GitHub Release contains the standalone Finder executable and the EDMC plugin package:

```text
ED-Hotspots-Finder-Rings-and-Planets-v1.0.2.exe
Hotspots-Finder-EDMC-Plugin-v1.0.2.zip
```

The public Windows executable remains unsigned, so Windows SmartScreen may display an unknown-publisher warning.

# v1.0.1 — RhinoSpotter compatibility update

This maintenance release updates the RhinoSpotter integration for the storage format used by current RhinoSpotter releases.

## Changes

- Added automatic detection of the RhinoSpotter SQLite bookmark database at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RhinoSpotter\db\rhinospotter.db`.
- Reads the RhinoSpotter database in SQLite read-only mode.
- Preserves support for legacy JSON card folders as a fallback.
- Preserves stable report IDs so previously synchronized bookmarks are updated rather than duplicated.
- Updated Settings to show the detected RhinoSpotter source and bookmark count.
- Updated the upload confirmation and completion summary to use bookmark/database terminology.
- Improved Settings window initialization so it opens already rendered instead of exposing intermediate layout states.
- Updated RhinoSpotter and Community Deposits documentation for the current workflow.

The integration was tested with newly created RhinoSpotter 4.4.3 bookmarks as well as previously migrated records.

# v1.0.0 — First public Windows release

This is the **first public release** of **ED Hotspots Finder - Rings & Planets**.

The project went through several internal development iterations before release; those internal version labels are not part of the public release history. Public versioning therefore starts at **v1.0.0**.

ED Hotspots Finder is built around **multi-system search and filtering**, with a particular focus on finding systems that satisfy the strategic and physical requirements of **Powerplay-oriented research**.

## Highlights

- Standalone Windows interface.
- Manual **System Input** with Spansh-backed system-name normalization before scanning.
- **System Filters** for Faction, Powerplay power, Power States, Reference System and distance.
- Search large candidate groups for the ring, hotspot and planetary characteristics required by a task.
- Hotspot searches with ring/mineral filters and **Only Pristine**.
- Planet searches with body-type filters, **Only Landables**, volcanism and arrival-distance data where available.
- Integrated **Community Deposits** results from the ED Alliance Community Deposits service.
- Optional RhinoSpotter synchronization for contributing compatible local discoveries to the shared database.
- Local result tables with sorting/filtering.
- Export of the current result tab to **CSV** and **XLSX**.
- Expand/Restore results view and detailed activity log.
- Themes: **Deep Black** and **Green Warm**.
- UI Scale options: 100%, 110%, 115% and 125%, with 115% as the default.
- Startup splash and first-window reveal handling designed to avoid visible initialization flicker on Windows.
- Application icon and Windows executable metadata prepared for the first public release.

## Search behavior

Manual system names are canonicalized through the same Spansh lookup used by Reference System. For example, differently cased inputs such as `mehit`, `wuRANgo` or `SEEDI` are resolved to the canonical names before the scan proceeds.

Duplicates are removed after canonicalization.

The same workflow can also begin from System Filters, allowing commanders to define a Powerplay, faction or distance-based search area before checking the resulting systems for the required hotspot, ring and planetary characteristics.

## Community Deposits and RhinoSpotter

The desktop app can query the **ED Alliance Community Deposits** service and display known player-reported surface deposits.

The long-term goal is to build a useful shared database of planetary deposits from discoveries contributed by the community.

The current release includes optional synchronization of compatible local RhinoSpotter records with Community Deposits. RhinoSpotter is an independent EDMC project developed by **Fumlop**:

https://github.com/Fumlop/EDRhinoSpotter

See the repository documentation for more information about Community Deposits and the current RhinoSpotter workflow.

## Local settings

The application stores its settings in:

```text
%APPDATA%\HotspotsFinder\config.json
```

## Export

Results can be exported locally:

- CSV: UTF-8 with BOM and semicolon delimiter.
- XLSX: locally generated workbook with frozen headers and autofilter.

## Windows build

The first public release uses Windows version metadata **1.0.0.0**.

The repository still contains internal source/build filenames using `v8` because that was the final development iteration before the public `v1.0.0` release. Those internal labels do not indicate previous public releases.

The Windows build uses:

- entry point: `hotspots_finder_gui_v8_final.py`
- PyInstaller spec: `HotspotsFinder-v8.spec`
- icon: `app.ico`
- splash: `ED_Hotspots_Finder.png`
- public version metadata: `1.0.0.0`
- executable name: `ED Hotspots Finder - Rings & Planets.exe`

The public Windows executable is currently unsigned, so Windows SmartScreen may display an unknown-publisher warning.

## Notes

Spansh and Community Deposits are community-data sources. Missing or outdated source data can affect search results.
